Lua [YAML] serialization using [LibYAML].

Usage
-----

    require 'yaml'

    serialized = yaml.dump{1, 2, 3, 4}
    content = yaml.load(serialized)

Description
-----------

This module is a Lua binding for Kirill Siminov's excellent [LibYAML].
LibYAML is generally considered to be the best C YAML 1.1 implementation.

This module defines the functions dump, load, and configure within the
global `yaml` table.

Portions of this software were inspired by Ingy d√∂t Net's [YAML::LibYAML]
Perl module.
